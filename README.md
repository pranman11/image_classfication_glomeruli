# image_classfication_glomeruli

Training and evaluation of various Neural Network models for 'Binary Classification of sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli' using microscopic images.
For simplicity 'class_0' is non-sclerotic and 'class_1' is sclerotic glomeruli.

Below is a summary of the trained models and their accuracy on a small test dataset.

| Model                   | Test Set Accuracy |
|------------------------:|-------------------|
|     Logistic Regression | 88%               |
|     Simple CNN model    | 96%               |
|     Frozen VGG16 model  | 98%               |
